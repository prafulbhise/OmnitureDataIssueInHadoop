/**
 * A tool for Hadoop eco system that makes it easier to parse Omniture Click Stream data.
 * It consists of custom input format and line reader. Works identically to TextInputFormat except for
 * the fact that it uses a EscapedLineReader which gets around Omniture's pesky escaped tabs and newlines.
 * For more information about format, please refer to Omniture Documentation at
 * https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/clickstream/analytics_clickstream.pdf.
